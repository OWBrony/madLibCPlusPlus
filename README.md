# Overview

This is a Mad Lib program which uses the C++ language. This is to show a competent understanding of the language and as a personal exercise in learning the C++
language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This program was made entirely within Visual Studio Code.
The language that was used to construct this was C++. Standard libraries of iostream
and string were used.
# Useful Websites

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/default.asp)

# Future Work

* Allow the use of multi-word answers in the first Mad Lib (example: baluga whale).
* I need to try to get this program to run with classes.
* I might one day make this run outside the terminal with a graphical display.
